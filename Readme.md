when holding a sword, left click to attack, right click to block.
move your mouse at the moment of clicking to change the direction of the attack or block.
you can hold both attacks and blocks by not releasing the mouse key.
to block an attack you must hold the block in the direction the attack is coming from until the sword makes contact with your player.
you must also face the attacker you intend to block, with knives you must face them more precisely.
it is suggested to disable all other types of melee damage.
on the github and forum page there are tweaked versions of sprint, character_anim, and mobs to add functionality.
if the custom sprint mod is added, attacks will use up stamina, and when you are low stamina your attacks will do less damage and be slower.
if the custom sprint mod is added, sucessfully blocking an attack will give you a stamina boost.
you can copy and paste the sword definitions in init.lua to make your own swords, attacks and blocks are defined with position and rotation vectors for both starting and ending positions/rotations.
